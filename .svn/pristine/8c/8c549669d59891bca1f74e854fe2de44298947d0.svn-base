Steps to create:

1) Download poms to be included
2) Rewrite their /project/version - AS has 5.1.0-SNAPSHOT for several releases.
3) Run transformToCSV.sh to get CSV from it
4) Append more poms to a single big CSV
5) Run transpose.sh on it
6) Result is in the result-table.csv.
7) Open in OpenOffice Calc, copy'n'paste to the wiki editor.


TODO: Overall script which would do the above automatically, just given the pom.xml URLs.
